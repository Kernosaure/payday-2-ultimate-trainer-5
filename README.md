### Questions and answers

**The mod does not work.**

Check the following :

- You have successfully installed SuperBLT (note you must also install **Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable package (x86)**).
- You have deleted any previous version of Ultimate Trainer.
- You have placed the `UltimateTrainer5` folder (from the archive) in your `PAYDAY 2/mods` folder.
- You don't use a mod that skip the game intro and you don't use the "-skip_intro" command.

**Can I get banned using this mod ?**

PAYDAY 2 does not have Steam VAC, therefore you cannot be banned by using this mod.

However PAYDAY 2 has a basic anti cheat that detects some features. If you use them, you may be kicked from the lobby or have a CHEATER tag next to your name. This has no consequences and disappears automatically.

**Why do I start heists with only 30% of my health ?**

This is due to the "Frenzy" skill of the "Fugitive" tree :

> Basic (4 pt): You only get 30% of your maximum health and cannot heal above it [...].
